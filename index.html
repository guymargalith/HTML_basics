    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>A recent Masters graduate in Chemical Engineering working towards a career in IT and technology. 
        I have developed a passion for IT solutions during my degree and solidified that interest while 
        developing an extensive MATLAB simulation for my Masters Research Project. I have since been improving 
        my programming skills using online resources such as online courses and websites like CodeWars. Recently 
        I have developed a Microsoft Access database to manage private lessons scheduling, which enhanced my understanding of VBA and SQL.</p>
    <p>I have a history of excellent numerical and complex problem-solving skills, as well as being a very receptive learner. 
        My leadership and teamwork skills have been put to use during my 4 years playing for the University of Birmingham Men's 
        Basketball Club, where I also acted as Vice Club President and Team Captain.</p>
