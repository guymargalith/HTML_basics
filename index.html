        <h2 class="heading highlight">About Me</h2>
        <p class="me-p highlight">A recent Masters graduate in Chemical Engineering working towards a career in IT and technology. 
            I have developed a passion for IT solutions during my degree and solidified that interest while 
            developing an extensive MATLAB simulation for my Masters Research Project. I have since been improving 
            my programming skills using online resources such as online courses and websites like CodeWars. Recently 
            I have developed a Microsoft Access database to manage private lessons scheduling, which enhanced my understanding of VBA and SQL.</p>
        <p class="me-p highlight">I have a history of excellent numerical and complex problem-solving skills, as well as being a very receptive learner. 
            My leadership and teamwork skills have been put to use during my 4 years playing for the University of Birmingham Men's 
            Basketball Club, where I also acted as Vice Club President and Team Captain.</p>
